# OIT_Challenge
Coding challenge for OIT Software Developer job

# Challenges 
Ran into an issue calling my local server. Tried a couple of different things but I could never track down why my attempts to reach the server were being blocked so with the last remaining minutes I create my Dummy data to have something on the Webapp

# Running
For the webservice run npm install then API_KEY={Your api key} node Webserver.js

For the webapp run npm install followed by npm run serve
